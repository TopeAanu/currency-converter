# currency-converter

After completing a frontend program at mimo.io, i built top-currency-converter. I implemented most of the concepts i learned in javascript (fetched the currency data from an api). 

Cc was built with html, css, and javascript. view the project [here](https://topcurrencyconverter-app.netlify.app/).
